    <p>The Hispanic Business Student Association at OSU was initiated on February 23, 1994. The goals and purposes of the National Hispanic Business Association and HBSA are to:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Increase enrollment of Hispanics in higher educational programs.</li>
			<li>Assist organizations in recruiting, developing, and promoting Hispanic professionals.</li>
      <li>Provide networking and career opportunities.</li>
      <li>Promote Hispanic business leadership and entrepreneurship.</li>
      <li>To voice the concerns of Hispanic students and alumni interested in a career as professionals in the business world.</li>
    </ul>
		<p>HBSA promotes the educational and professional careers of its members with an emphasis on the Hispanic minority population at The Ohio State University. Members are encouraged to become future leaders in the business world. Inspiring guest speakers, from the public and private sector, are invited to present. Companies, organizations and individuals are solicited to host workshops which are designed to address educational issues, business trends, and career opportunities relating to Hispanics.</p>
    <p>The organization is open to all graduate and undergraduate students who support strengthening the Hispanic business agenda by indicating a strong interest in promoting business education and the professional advancement of Hispanics.</p>
    <p>HBSA meets every other week and actively participates in Hispanic Awareness Week activities, conducts research, submits scholarly articles for campus, community, and national publications, and attends the annual NHBA Hispanic Business Student Leadership Conference.</p>
    <p>The Ohio State University chapter of HBSA, works very closely with Career Services, Minority Student Services, the Office of Student Life and the Max M. Fisher College of Business and other non-university organizations to increase job opportunities and the professional development of its membership.</p>
    <p>David Harrison is HBSA's advisor and the Director of Minority Student Services. He not only serves as a liaison between our members and the Max M. Fisher College of Business but Faculty, Staff and Administrators at The Ohio State University.</p>
